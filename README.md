# kiwi 🥝
A high-level language similar to Ruby and Python. Hoping to create a collection of helpful standard lib functions to help in interviews.

Things like:
- Dynamic types
- Simple to use double-ended queues/lists
- Simple to use heap and tree datastructures
- Variety of string helper functions

### How to Run:
Theres a file in `test/sample.kiwi` which you can add your code into. Right now it's pretty basic

```js
// Math
var x = (100 + 15) / 3;
print x;

// Conditions
print "foo" or "bar";

// Variable Declaration
var name = "John";

// Variable Assignment
name = "Jane";

// Printing to STDOUT
print name;
```
